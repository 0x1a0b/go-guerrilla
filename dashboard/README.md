# Dashboard

The dashboard package gathers data about Guerrilla while it is running and provides an analytics web dashboard. To activate the dashboard, add it to your configuration file.

## Frontend

The front-end is written in React and uses WebSockets to accept data from the backend and [Victory](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/) to render charts.
